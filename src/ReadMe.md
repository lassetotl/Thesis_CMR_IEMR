### Source Code for master's thesis
## Note: only works with access to IEMR OUS R-disk, access to TPM combodata

### CombodataSR_2D.py
Contains a python class that takes combodata (with TPM magnitude, velocity fields in two spatial dimensions + time) as input. It produces and returns global strain rate data and can save these as separate files, as well as save videos that visualize the velocity vector field and strain rate as ellipses. See file for example of use.
