Here's how to perform a dependent longitudinal ANOVA test in Python. This test, also known as repeated measures ANOVA, is used when you have the same subjects being measured at multiple time points.
Data Preparation: The data should be in "long" format, where each row represents a single measurement for a subject at a specific time point.
Python
'''
import pandas as pd
    
data = {'subject_id': [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3],
        'time_point': [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3],
        'measurement': [10, 12, 15, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)

'''
Performing the ANOVA: The statsmodels library can be used to perform the repeated measures ANOVA.
Python
'''

from statsmodels.formula.api import ols
from statsmodels.stats.anova import anova_lm
    
formula = 'measurement ~ C(time_point) + C(subject_id)'
model = ols(formula, data=df).fit()
anova_table = anova_lm(model)
print(anova_table)

'''
C(time_point): This treats time_point as a categorical variable.
C(subject_id): This accounts for the dependency of measurements within each subject.
The output table shows the F-statistic, p-value, and degrees of freedom, indicating if there's a significant effect of time on the measurement.
Assumptions:
Before interpreting the results, it's important to check the assumptions of repeated measures ANOVA:
Normality: The residuals should be approximately normally distributed.
Sphericity: The variances of the differences between all combinations of related groups should be equal. Mauchly's test can be used to test for sphericity. If violated, a correction method like Greenhouse-Geisser or Huynh-Feldt should be applied.
Independence: While the measurements within subjects are dependent, the measurements between subjects should be independent.
Post-hoc Tests:
If the ANOVA results are significant, post-hoc tests (e.g., paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction) can be used to determine which time points differ significantly from each other.
